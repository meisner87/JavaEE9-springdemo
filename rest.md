### Rest principles

- based on JSON payload
- using http protocol

### HTTP codes family

- 1xx - processing in progress
- 2xx - success
- 3xx - redirects
- 4xx - client's errors
- 5xx - server's errors

### http message consists of:

- request
- url
- headers
- body

- response
- status code
- headers
- body

###CRUD over Http(Create/Read/Update/Delete)
- read data
  - Get method
- create data
  - POST method
- delete data
  - DELETE method
- update data
  - PUT method - for replacing data
  - PATCH method - for partial update

- urls - good practice(playing with person)
- use nouns for names of your endpoints(not verb)
- we need to treat items like hierarchical collections
    - read
        - whole collections: /persons - with GET
        - one item: /persons/{id} - with GET, eg. /persons/1 
        - status code for nonexisting id should be 404
    - create
        - url: /persons - with POST
        - payload put inside request body
    - delete
        - url: /persons/{id} - with DELETE, eg. /persons/1
        - no content in response - use 204 status code
        - status code for nonexisting id should be 404
    - update
        - url: /persons/{id} - with PUT, eg. /persons/1 - replace object
        - url: /persons/{id} - with PATCH, eg. /persons/1 - partial update
